/*!
 Subclass of polygon used when I render a SIDE of a CUBE WRAPPER (skybox)
 for the scene, simulating a closed room (some sort of skybox but with a 
 limited distance). Used to higlight soft shadow in some scenes.
 
 @attention I need ONE INSTANCE of this class FOR EACH SIDE. The method 
 that read the texture is common for all direction of ray (simply drop a 
 component based on intersection point)

 Method used to read the texture data based on the coordinate
 of the intersection point. The Polygon sides are align with the 
 axes so is easy to do the map: drop the coordinate to 0 and 
 apply a conversion to texture coordinate system as a percentage
 of height/width.
 
 @param intersectionPoint the point of intersection
 
 @returns A Vector3D with rgb components of the texture texel.
