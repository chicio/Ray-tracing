/*!
 Subclass of polygon used when we render a SIDE of a CUBE WRAPPER for the scene,
 simulating a closed room (some sort of skybox but with a limit distance).
 Used to higlight soft shadow in some scenes. 
 
 @attention We need ONE INSTANCE FOR EACH SIDE. The method that read the texture
 is common for all direction of ray (simply drop a component based on intersection
 point)

 Method used to read the texture data based on the coordinate
 of the intersection point. The Polygon sides are align with the 
 axes so is easy to do the map: drop the coordinate to 0 and 
 apply a conversion to texture coordinate system as a percentage
 of height/width.
 
 @param intersectionPoint the point of intersection
 
 @returns A Vector3D with rgb components of the texture texel.
