/*!
 Calculate the intersection of the square with a ray.
 
 @attention for the intersection I use the method contained
 in the document linked below.
 It is a general version of the triangle intersection test in which I check
 that an intersection point is on the left of every edge. This method work
 only for CONVEX polygon. For other kind of polygon something like winding
 number rule or odd even rule must be used.
 
 @see https://sites.google.com/site/justinscsstuff/object-intersection
 
 @param ray the ray used to calculate the intersection.
 
 @returns a dictionary that contains t, intersection point, normal and the polygon itself.
